// Theory:
//   Solidity is a high-level language. The structure of smart contracts in solidity is very
//similar to the structure of classes in object-oriented languages. The solidity file has an
//extension .sol.
//   What are Smart Contracts?
//   Solidityâ€™s code is encapsulated in contracts which means a contract in Solidity is a
//collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that resides at a specific address on
//the Ethereum blockchain. A contract is a fundamental block of building an application
//on Ethereum.
//   The aim is to deploy a Smart Contract for Marks Management System by using Solidity.
//In this contract, the details of every student like student ID, Name, Marks, etc can be
//added and if one wants to give some bonus marks to students then they can also be added.
//After building the contract all the details of every student can be retrieved.
