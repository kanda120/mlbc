#Theory: 
#    Linear regression is one of the easiest and most popular Machine Learning
#algorithms. It is a statistical method that is used for predictive analysis. Linear
#regression makes predictions for continuous/real or numeric variables such as sales,
#salary, age, product price, etc.
#   Linear regression algorithm shows a linear relationship between a dependent (y) and
#one or more independent (y) variables, hence called as linear regression. Since linear
#regression shows the linear relationship, which means it finds how the value of the
#dependent variable is changing according to the value of the independent variable.
#   The linear regression model provides a sloped straight line representing the
#relationship between the variables.
#Mathematically, we can represent a linear regression as: y= a0+a1x+ Îµ

# Algorithm is hidden in '#' above code
